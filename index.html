    <p><strong>Uptown Vocal</strong> is the premier jazz and pop a cappella group of Columbia University in the city of New York. As we enter our third decade of bringing jazz/pop to the CU community, our repertoire includes major pop hits like Katy Perry's <em>"Teenage Dream"</em> and Adele's <em>"Skyfall"</em>, as well as timeless jazz standards such as <em>"Take Five"</em> and <em>"Come Fly With Me"</em>.</p>

    <p>We perform at numerous functions both on and off campus throughout the year and regularly grace other college campuses with our musical talent and unusual attractiveness.</p>
