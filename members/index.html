    <h2 class="sans">Betsey Giammattei</h2>
    <p>Hailing from Tampa, Florida, <strong>Betsey Giammattei</strong> is probably more famous than you. With more YouTube hits than Ben Kaplan, she is poised to take over the internet with her original songs, stunning soprano, and--of course--unusual attractiveness. She can also speak Chinese, which will aide her in her quest for international stardom. Before Betsey really blows up, though, the Columbia community will have the privilege of watching her perform, free of charge, for four years. Both a solid group member and a knockout soloist, Betsey is definitely one to watch, and she'll surely keep listeners coming back for more. </p>

    <h2 class="sans">Danielle Strassman</h2>
    <p><strong>Danielle Strassman</strong> spends most of her time taking advantage of the East Coast, a different flavor from her West Coast origins of Los Angeles. When she isn't singing like a diva in rehearsals, she can be found flipping grilled cheese for Columbia University's "Feel Good", an organization that donates its proceeds to help destroy world hunger. As a fellow 'Doctor Who' and 'Buffy' fanatic, Danielle's big voice and even bigger heart complete the UV ensemble.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Emile Motta de Castro</h2>
    <p><strong>Emile Motta de Castro</strong> brings his smooth dance moves and even smoother tenor blend to Uptown Vocal this year. A well-versed vocalist hailing from Chicago, LA, Miami, and even Argentina, this kid’s got a story to his travels, his name, and even his Trilogy. Better yet, he can tell you these stories in fluent Spanish! When he isn’t lighting up the quiet hallways of Furnald with his melodious voice, Emile can be found breakdancing outside of Roone -- we kid you not. Uptown Vocal couldn’t be more ecstatic to welcome Emile as the newest tenor addition to our UV family.

    <h2 class="sans">Gabriel Blanco - President</h2>
    <p><strong>Gabriel Blanco</strong> joins UV from a point precisely equidistant from Venezula, Switzerland, and Cincinnati. His extremely fresh bass singing is matched only by his superhuman mastery of electricity, which will only grow as he continues his study of Electrical Engineering. He cultivates the intersections between his engineering knowledge and love of music, and he is currently designing an innovative effects pedal which makes a guitar sound like a vocal jazz group. Gabe is not only a bass but an electric bassist; indeed, fans and critics alike claim to hear a hint of the instrument's powerful rumble as Gabe sings.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Heather Nickels</h2>
    <p><strong>Heather Nickels</strong> is a girl with simple tastes. All it takes to make her happy is a good book, a cold glass of soda and her own villa somewhere in the Tuscan region of Italy. And that villa better come stocked with a closet full of designer clothes. And tons of kick-ass platform shoes. And a private jet. You know what? Scratch that. The villa is actual a hidden base of operations where she can lead her double life as Nikita, a jet-setting secret agent. Who also steals diamonds.</p>

    <p>Alright, alright. So Heather may not exactly have "simple" tastes, but "simple" is so last year. Heather is multifaceted and multitalented. She's mysterious and awesome. And you know what? She's also got tremendous blend, an outrageous range and a sexy solo voice. And to top it all off? She's also cooler than you.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Jameson McBride</h2>
    <p><strong>Jameson McBride</strong> is a few years and a few gray hairs away from being a prime candidate to replace John Stewart on the Daily Show. He’s quick witted, silver tongued and worldly like no one’s business; well versed in topics ranging from the economic state of New England supermarkets to how to pick the most hipster Premier League football club to support. In addition to being the smarty pants that he is, Jameson is also an amazingly talented musician, sight reading Bach tunes for fun and playing Fleet Foxes on the piano to charm the ladies. I’m running out of space to compliment Jamie so let me just end by saying this: LL Beane, Jay-Z, Maine, Twitter, Red Sox, Sustainable Development, NPR, Flannel and Coffee.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Jonathan Dean</h2>
    <p><strong>Jonathan Dean</strong> aka Jonathan 'Light Blue' Deantini, hails from the cologne section of your favorite Filene's Basement. His buttery tenor falsetto will make you melt (that is, if you're still in solid form after gazing into his steely-crystal eyes.) Though known primarily for his golden pipes, Mr. Dean has a heart of platinum. He's always game to help out his friends, particularly in times of olfactory crisis, and may be counted on even when only one of his arms is working. He's sexy and he knows it-have you heard him sing the Moondance at parties?--but despite being a stand out soloist in a league of his own, he's one of the smoothest and blendiest members of the group, and we wouldn't be complete without him!</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Kunal Kamath - Treasurer</h2>
    <p><strong>Kunal Kamath</strong> has got a personality that can light up a room. That room happens to be Butler 209, at three in the morning, while he does Bhangra in the corridors to keep himself awake. But, he lights it up nonetheless! Coming to us all the way from Atlanta Georgia, you may be disappointed to learn that Kunal does not in fact have a southern accent, but he does carry with him a certain southern charm, which comes out when he solos in his smooth and sexy tenor tone. A charismatic crooner, Kunal “Kuny” Kamath can create cool chords quite competently.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Linda Cartolano</h2>
    <p><strong>Linda Cartolano</strong> is one of Uptown Vocal’s sweetest (and smallest) members. Her cheerful attitude and too-cute smile brighten every UV rehearsal and performance, but don’t be fooled – she sings like a true diva! Her wide range, big voice, and can-do attitude are awesome assets to the alto section. Linda and her many younger siblings come from Eastchester, New York... and after hearing us perform, maybe they’ll even form a sibling a cappella group of their own! Listen for her sassy solo in How Deep is Your Love/Ain’t No Mountain High Enough (UV arrangement by Allison Heimann), and many more to come.</p>

      <p><strong>Lizzy Karnaukh</strong> is a beautiful Russian ballerina who is as talented as she is adorable. She is equipped with stellar blending abilities, but her sweet soprano tone graces us with solos as well! She sounds especially zoppity on ballads. Lizzy hails from New Jersey, Uptown Vocal's favorite state. She glows with Princeton pride but absolutely loves her new home here in New York. In her spare time, Lizzy enjoys watching and/or crying over episodes of Doctor Who on Netflix. You can also find her devouring Annie's mac and cheese, giving amazing massages, or humming holiday tunes at any time of year. We love Lizzy and the group wouldn't be the same without her!</p>

      <h2 class="sans">Maddy Meyer</h2>
      <p><strong>Maddy Meyer</strong> is the newest addition to our sultry soprano section. She hails from the windy city of Chicago and brings some chill vibes to match. She's down for anything, even piercing her nose on a Thursday night in Carman. She generally maintains her pro figure skating poise, but give her a two-pound bag of jelly beans and she’ll devour them faster than you can say Miley Cyrus.</p>

      <h2 class="sans">Michael Gildin - Music Director</h2>
      <p><strong>Michael Gildin,</strong> as though willed by Vulcan, has smoothly wedded himself to the precious alloy that is Semper Sub. The lusters of his precise base lines and molten pelvic gestures have solidified the Bass Section (previously in flux), and enhanced its conductivity in terms of heat, electricity, and sexual magnetism. A truly noble metal, his musical talents allow him to excel in many extra-UVicular activities, but with great aplumbum, Mg makes his schedule ever malleable for the sake of Uptown Vocal. Michael is always on the next level. Known for his classy disposition and occasional knife wielding, never let him catch you saying that the party is cooling off, because he will promptly inform you that it is yet to begin. He came from Pennsylvania to study Political Science and Pre-Med at Columbia College, but what many don't know is that he is also a Jazz Pianist Extraordinaire. If you walk by John Jay Lounge at the right time of day, you just might hear a masterful jazz standard or two compliments of Michael Gildin. Above all else, however, he is a treasured member of Uptown Vocal and a welcome addition to Semper Sub. Michael is the greatest human being ever.</p>

      <p>Transferring from Emory University, <strong>Nate Barasch</strong> has made a glorious return to his home state of New York, bringing back with him a perfect blend of Southern class and East Coast cool. Don't be fooled by his icy blue eyes — Nate brings the warmth back up north with his hot jazz rhythms and his feverishly good iPhone bass beats. When he's not flying through bass lines, Nate can be found heating up discussions in Model UN and making the McBain shaft double cool again.</p>

      <p>Hailing from Fog City aka Sunnyvale, <strong>Nina Sabharwal</strong> graces us with her light and lovely mezzo tone and wonderful blend. Not only is she a fun and light-hearted SEAS-lady, but also our newest member! She’s down-to-earth, always dressed to the nines, and is definitely the most laid-back UVer. In her spare time, she likes to frolic around her favorite NYC ‘hood (obvz the Village), take oh-so-flattering selfies at the ‘dam, and (would finally like to) take belly dancing classes!</p>

      <p><strong>Victoria Alejandro</strong> is a beautiful and talented singer-songwriter hailing from Southern California. With her excited grin and confident personality, Victoria adds the perfect amount of spunk to Uptown Vocal. Not only does Victoria have an incredibly sultry and jazzy tone, she adores theatre and is a wonderful actress. Victoria spends her nights at multiple rehearsals and yet still manages to have enough energy to power a country. When not at one of her many practices, Victoria can be found exploring New York City, eating a burger at the Diana Center, or taking one of her coveted long naps. Victoria has always dreamed of becoming a famous jazz club singer. Don’t be surprised when her dream becomes a reality. Watch out world, this girl is a superstar! </p>
