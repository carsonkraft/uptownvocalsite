    <h2 class="sans">Emile Motta de Castro</h2>
    <p><strong>Emile Motta de Castro</strong> brings his smooth dance moves and even smoother tenor blend to Uptown Vocal this year. A well-versed vocalist hailing from Chicago, LA, Miami, and even Argentina, this kid’s got a story to his travels, his name, and even his Trilogy. Better yet, he can tell you these stories in fluent Spanish! When he isn’t lighting up the quiet hallways of Furnald with his melodious voice, Emile can be found breakdancing outside of Roone -- we kid you not. Uptown Vocal couldn’t be more ecstatic to welcome Emile as the newest tenor addition to our UV family.

    <h2 class="sans">Jameson McBride</h2>
    <p><strong>Jameson McBride</strong> is a few years and a few gray hairs away from being a prime candidate to replace John Stewart on the Daily Show. He’s quick witted, silver tongued and worldly like no one’s business; well versed in topics ranging from the economic state of New England supermarkets to how to pick the most hipster Premier League football club to support. In addition to being the smarty pants that he is, Jameson is also an amazingly talented musician, sight reading Bach tunes for fun and playing Fleet Foxes on the piano to charm the ladies. I’m running out of space to compliment Jamie so let me just end by saying this: LL Beane, Jay-Z, Maine, Twitter, Red Sox, Sustainable Development, NPR, Flannel and Coffee.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Jon Shapiro</h2>
    <p><strong>Jon Shapiro</strong> is ready to make it big in the big city, trading in the comfortable plaid-and-khakis of suburban Westchester for the suit-and-tie of the Uptown Life. Jon, or “Shappy” as he is affectionately referred to, is a talented multi-instrumentalist. In the down time between rehearsals, he can often be found playing beautiful jazz standards, while we just sit back and tap our collective feet and stroke our chins introspectively. During parties, he’s more apt to grab the nearest guitar and belt out a lively rendition of a Beatles tune to get us all twisting and shouting. Jon is a very witty guy with bundles of musical talent, an expansive knowledge of musical trivia, a keen fashion sense and an excellent sense of humor. He may not the greatest snowman builder, but we won’t hold that against him.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Kunal Kamath - Music Director</h2>
    <p><strong>Kunal Kamath</strong> has got a personality that can light up a room. That room happens to be Butler 209, at three in the morning, while he does Bhangra in the corridors to keep himself awake. But, he lights it up nonetheless! Coming to us all the way from Atlanta Georgia, you may be disappointed to learn that Kunal does not in fact have a southern accent, but he does carry with him a certain southern charm, which comes out when he solos in his smooth and sexy tenor tone. A charismatic crooner, Kunal “Kuny” Kamath can create cool chords quite competently.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Linda Cartolano</h2>
    <p><strong>Linda Cartolano</strong> is one of Uptown Vocal’s sweetest (and smallest) members. Her cheerful attitude and too-cute smile brighten every UV rehearsal and performance, but don’t be fooled – she sings like a true diva! Her wide range, big voice, and can-do attitude are awesome assets to the alto section. Linda and her many younger siblings come from Eastchester, New York... and after hearing us perform, maybe they’ll even form a sibling a cappella group of their own! Listen for her sassy solo in How Deep is Your Love/Ain’t No Mountain High Enough (UV arrangement by Allison Heimann), and many more to come.</p>

      <h2 class="sans">Lizzy Karnaukh - President</h2>
      <p><strong>Lizzy Karnaukh</strong> is a beautiful Russian ballerina who is as talented as she is adorable. She is equipped with stellar blending abilities, but her sweet soprano tone graces us with solos as well! She sounds especially zoppity on ballads. Lizzy hails from New Jersey, Uptown Vocal's favorite state. She glows with Princeton pride but absolutely loves her new home here in New York. In her spare time, Lizzy enjoys watching and/or crying over episodes of Doctor Who on Netflix. You can also find her devouring Annie's mac and cheese, giving amazing massages, or humming holiday tunes at any time of year. We love Lizzy and the group wouldn't be the same without her!</p>

      <h2 class="sans">Maddy Meyer - Treasurer</h2>
      <p><strong>Maddy Meyer</strong> is the newest addition to our sultry soprano section. She hails from the windy city of Chicago and brings some chill vibes to match. She's down for anything, even piercing her nose on a Thursday night in Carman. She generally maintains her pro figure skating poise, but give her a two-pound bag of jelly beans and she’ll devour them faster than you can say Miley Cyrus.</p>

      <h2 class="sans">Nate Barasch</h2>
      <p>Transferring from Emory University, <strong>Nate Barasch</strong> has made a glorious return to his home state of New York, bringing back with him a perfect blend of Southern class and East Coast cool. Don't be fooled by his icy blue eyes — Nate brings the warmth back up north with his hot jazz rhythms and his feverishly good iPhone bass beats. When he's not flying through bass lines, Nate can be found heating up discussions in Model UN and making the McBain shaft double cool again.</p>

      <h2 class="sans">Nina Sabharwal</h2>
      <p>Hailing from Fog City aka Sunnyvale, <strong>Nina Sabharwal</strong> graces us with her light and lovely mezzo tone and wonderful blend. Not only is she a fun and light-hearted SEAS-lady, but also our newest member! She’s down-to-earth, always dressed to the nines, and is definitely the most laid-back UVer. In her spare time, she likes to frolic around her favorite NYC ‘hood (obvz the Village), take oh-so-flattering selfies at the ‘dam, and (would finally like to) take belly dancing classes!</p>

      <h2 class="sans">Victoria Alejandro</h2>
      <p><strong>Victoria Alejandro</strong> is a beautiful and talented singer-songwriter hailing from Southern California. With her excited grin and confident personality, Victoria adds the perfect amount of spunk to Uptown Vocal. Not only does Victoria have an incredibly sultry and jazzy tone, she adores theatre and is a wonderful actress. Victoria spends her nights at multiple rehearsals and yet still manages to have enough energy to power a country. When not at one of her many practices, Victoria can be found exploring New York City, eating a burger at the Diana Center, or taking one of her coveted long naps. Victoria has always dreamed of becoming a famous jazz club singer. Don’t be surprised when her dream becomes a reality. Watch out world, this girl is a superstar! </p>
