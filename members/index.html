    <h2 class="sans">Maddy Meyer - Business Manager</h2>
    <p><strong>Maddy Meyer</strong> brings the heat to our sultry soprano section. She hails from the windy city of Chicago and adds some chill vibes to match. She's down for anything, even piercing her nose on a Thursday night in Carman. She generally maintains her pro figure skating poise, but give her a two-pound bag of jelly beans and she’ll devour them faster than you can say Miley Cyrus.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Jameson McBride</h2>
    <p><strong>Jameson McBride</strong> is a few years and a few gray hairs away from being a prime candidate to replace John Stewart on the Daily Show. He’s quick witted, silver tongued and worldly like no one’s business; well versed in topics ranging from the economic state of New England supermarkets to how to pick the most hipster Premier League football club to support. In addition to being the smarty pants that he is, Jameson is also an amazingly talented musician, sight reading Bach tunes for fun and playing Fleet Foxes on the piano to charm the ladies. I’m running out of space to compliment Jamie so let me just end by saying this: LL Beane, Jay-Z, Maine, Twitter, Red Sox, Sustainable Development, NPR, Flannel and Coffee.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Linda Cartolano</h2>
      <p><strong>Linda Cartolano</strong> is one of Uptown Vocal’s sweetest (and smallest) members. Her cheerful attitude and too-cute smile brighten every UV rehearsal and performance, but don’t be fooled – she sings like a true diva! Her wide range, big voice, and can-do attitude are awesome assets to the alto section. She is a student teacher extraordinaire whose natural talent is indispensable in leading the alluring altos during sectionals. She packs a punch in her scats and is an exceptional counter (up to 4!!).</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Kunal Kamath - President</h2>
    <p><strong>Kunal Kamath</strong> has got a personality that can light up a room. That room happens to be Butler 209, at three in the morning, while he does Bhangra in the corridors to keep himself awake, but he lights it up nonetheless! Coming to us all the way from Atlanta, you may be disappointed to learn that Kunal does not in fact have a Southern accent, but he does carry with him a certain Southern charm, which comes out when he solos in his smooth and sexy tenor tone. His secret innovative tendencies often shine through; just ask him about ice cream flavors or beezing.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Lizzy Karnaukh</h2>
    <p><strong>Lizzy Karnaukh</strong> is a beautiful Russian ballerina who is as talented as she is adorable. She is equipped with stellar blending abilities, but her sweet soprano tone graces us with solos as well! She sounds especially zoppity on ballads. Lizzy hails from New Jersey, Uptown Vocal's favorite state. She glows with Princeton pride but absolutely loves her new home here in New York. In her spare time, Lizzy enjoys watching and/or crying over episodes of Doctor Who on Netflix. You can also find her devouring Annie's mac and cheese, giving amazing massages, or humming holiday tunes at any time of year. We love Lizzy and the group wouldn't be the same without her!</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Jon Shapiro - Music Director</h2>
    <p><strong>Jon Shapiro</strong> is ready to make it big in the big city, trading in the comfortable plaid-and-khakis of suburban Westchester for the suit-and-tie of the Uptown Life. Jon, or “Shappy” as he is affectionately referred to, is a talented multi-instrumentalist. In the down time between rehearsals, he can often be found playing beautiful jazz standards, while we just sit back and tap our collective feet and stroke our chins introspectively. During parties, he’s more apt to grab the nearest guitar and belt out a lively rendition of a Beatles tune to get us all twisting and shouting. Jon is a very witty guy with bundles of musical talent, an expansive knowledge of musical trivia, a keen fashion sense and an excellent sense of humor. He may not the greatest snowman builder, but we won’t hold that against him.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Victoria Alejandro</h2>
    <p><strong>Victoria Alejandro</strong> is a beautiful and talented singer-songwriter hailing from Southern California. With her excited grin and confident personality, Victoria adds the perfect amount of spunk to Uptown Vocal. Not only does Victoria have an incredibly sultry and jazzy tone, she adores theatre and is a wonderful actress. Victoria spends her nights at multiple rehearsals and yet still manages to have enough energy to power a country. When not at one of her many practices, Victoria can be found exploring New York City, eating a burger at the Diana Center, or taking one of her coveted long naps. Victoria has always dreamed of becoming a famous jazz club singer. Don’t be surprised when her dream becomes a reality. Watch out world, this girl is a superstar! </p>

    <h2 class="sans">Emile Motta de Castro</h2>
    <p><strong>Emile Motta de Castro</strong> brings his smooth dance moves and even smoother tenor blend to Uptown Vocal this year. A well-versed vocalist hailing from Chicago, LA, Miami, and even Argentina, this kid’s got a story to his travels, his name, and even his Trilogy. Better yet, he can tell you these stories in fluent Spanish! When he isn’t lighting up the quiet hallways of Furnald with his melodious voice, Emile can be found breakdancing outside of Roone -- we kid you not. Uptown Vocal couldn’t be more ecstatic to have Emile as the suavest tenor addition to our UV family.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Nate Barasch</h2>
    <p>Transferring from Emory University, <strong>Nate Barasch</strong> has made a glorious return to his home state of New York, bringing back with him a perfect blend of Southern class and East Coast cool. Don't be fooled by his icy blue eyes — Nate brings the warmth back up north with his hot jazz rhythms and his feverishly good iPhone bass beats. When he's not flying through bass lines, Nate can be found heating up discussions in Model UN and making the McBain shaft double cool again.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Carson Kraft - Publicity Manager</h2>
      <p>Our newest soprano, <strong>Carson Kraft</strong> hails from the lovely city of San Fran, and her beautiful high timbre is the only thing that can cut through Liam’s social justice rants. She studies computer science, serves as a fashion trendsetter for the rest of us, and is a frequent visitor of JJ’s place, from where she draws her aesthetic inspiration. You better watch out – she isn’t afraid to knock a couple belters down to get to the top of the UV social pyramid.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Karinya Ghiara - Treasurer</h2>
    <p><strong>Karinya Ghiara</strong> has an exceptionally strong yet sweet alto tone to match her refreshingly kind and upbeat personality. Originally from San Diego, Karinya arrived in New York City with a smile on her face and excitement in her eyes. Her cheery attitude brings much appreciated humor and energy to Uptown Vocal. In addition to her vivacity and vocal skill, Karinya loves theatre and is a fabulous actress. It may seem like Karinya could not wipe the smile off her face if she tried, but don’t be fooled- when she slips into whatever character she is playing, you might not even recognize her! Karinya was born to perform and is an incredible asset to Uptown Vocal. Most importantly, Karinya really loves a good grilled cheese.</p>

    <h2 class="sans">Nina Sabharwal</h2>
    <p>
    Hailing from Fog City aka Sunnyvale, <strong>Nina Sabharwal</strong> graces us with her melodic ease, lovely mezzo tone, and wonderful blend. While she never leaves her BME haven in Mudd, she’s incredibly down-to-earth, always dressed to the nines, and is definitely the most laid-back UVer. In her spare time, she likes to frolic around her favorite NYC ‘hood (obvz the Village) and take oh-so-flattering selfies at the ‘dam. She also loves a mean fruit salad.
