  <h1>About UV</h1>

  <div class="p1">
  <p>Uptown Vocal was founded in 1991 by David Wienir, Rachel Tepfer and Rachel Harmon (n√©e Rezak) as a co-ed A Cappella group at Columbia University. We began as the Catatonics, a fun-loving crew with big dreams of bringing the beautiful sounds of A Cappella to the Columbia community. It wasn't until 1995 that we took on the name Uptown Vocal and quickly became Columbia University's Premiere Jazz/Pop A Cappella Group!</p>

  <p>Twenty years and 6 CDs later, we continue on our mission to make cool music while having a great time doing it, too! Along the way, we've honed our distinct Jazzy sound, picked up our signature "UV-niform" (black suit, blue tie, black dress) and cultivated a love for all things frijoles negros. We've performed on Cruise Ships, at the White House, at the Yankee's 100th Anniversary Dinner, and even opened for Ben Folds!</p>
