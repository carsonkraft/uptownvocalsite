**Uptown Vocal** is the premier jazz and pop a cappella group of Columbia University in the city of New York. As we enter our third decade of bringing jazz/pop to the CU community, our repertoire includes major pop hits like Katy Perry's *"Teenage Dream"* and Adele's *"Skyfall"*, as well as timeless jazz standards such as *"Take Five"* and *"Come Fly With Me"*.

We perform at numerous functions both on and off campus throughout the year and regularly grace other college campuses with our musical talent and unusual attractiveness.
